## Installation

You can find the newest _.unitypackage_ file on [my itch.io account](https://molendinumgames.itch.io/) or in [this repository](https://github.com/MolendinumGames/UnityCoreTools/tree/main/Assets/DevConsole)

**Note:** This package requires TextMeshPro, which is included in any modern standard version of Unity.

I recommend using an engine version of **Unity2021.3LTS or higher**.

## Getting Started
To use the dev console in play mode or in a build it must be present in the scene.
You add the developer console to a scene by selecting the tools tab at the top of
your editor and select "Tools/Add Developer Console".<p>
There is a small list of simple commands to get started. Try opening the console in play mode by pressing _tab_ and then typing _/help_ followed by enter to see a list of all commands.

## Adding Custom Commands
Add new C# file to _`Assets/DevConsole/Commands`_ and replace the contents with the blueprint for a console command.<br>
The add your newly created command to the the `GetCommands()` Function inside _`Assets/DevConsole/Core/DevConsoleController`_ bewlow the comment informing you to add custom commands here.<br>
**Note:** Without this last step your command will not work!

<hr>

```csharp
namespace CoreTools.Console.Commands
{
    public class MyNewCommand : ConsoleCommand
    {
        // This will the command prompt. You will not have to add '/' to the string.
        public override string Command => "exit";
        
        // To be printed in the console in case the arguments of the command are wrong
        // Leave to string.Empty to skip.
        public override string WrongInputMessage => "This command doesn't take any inputs";

        // The output in case the command was successfully executed.
        // Leave to string.empty to skip.
        public override string SuccessMessage => string.Empty;

        // The logic of the command. the args array is the inputs sperated by space
        // not including the command itself.
        public override bool Process(string[] args)
        {
            // Example: The command doesn't take any argument
            if (args.Length > 0)
                return false;
            
            // Enter to code to be executed here:
            
            return true;
        }
    }
}
```

<hr>

You can create a backdrop field and use logic within the _Process(...)_ function to alter the output based on the mistake in the input.<br>
<b>For example:</b>

<hr>

```csharp
[...]
private string wrongInputMessage = String.Empty
public override string WrongInputMessage => wrongInputMessage;
private const string tooManyArguments = "The command takes less arguments."
privata const string notEnoughArguments = "I need more arguments."
[...]


 public override bool Process(string[] args)
 {
    if (args.Length > 4)
    {
        wrongInputMessage = tooManyArguments;
        return false;
    }
    else if (args.Length < 4)
    {
        wrongInputMessage = notEnoughArguments;
        return false;
    }
    else
    {
        // This is just right! Let's execute the command:
        [...]
    }
 }
```

<hr>

<b>I recommend taking a look at the initially provided command files to help getting started!</b>

## Changing the key binding
**Legacy Input System:**<br>
Change in the prefabs inspector under
_`Assets/DevConsole/Resources/ConsolePrefabs/DeveloperConsole`_ or in the inspector of the GameObject in the Scene.

**New Input System:**<br>
Open Assets/DevConsole/Core/DevConsoleController.
At the top of the class body you will see a property that retuns a KeyControl. Change the getter after the nullcheck.<br>
`e.g. Keyboard.current.aKey`

## Blocking Input while Open
The DevConsoleController has a static event OnConsoleOpen that you can subscribe to
to add functionality like blocking Input while using the console or freezing time.
You can reverse these by using the OnConsoleClose event.
