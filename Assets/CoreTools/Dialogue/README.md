## Installation
You can find the newest _.unitypackage_ file on [my itch.io account](https://molendinumgames.itch.io/) or in [this repository](https://github.com/MolendinumGames/UnityCoreTools/tree/main/Assets/CoreTools/Dialogue)

**Note:** This package requires TextMeshPro, which is included in any modern standard version of Unity.

I recommend using an engine version of **Unity2021.3LTS or higher**.
