<p>Fundamentals to create a node based editor workflow using Unity's Scricptable Objects. This system was also used to create the [Dialogue Editor]([https://github.com/MolendinumGames/UnityCoreTools/tree/main/Assets/ProductivityTools](https://github.com/MolendinumGames/UnityCoreTools/tree/main/Assets/CoreTools/Dialogue)) that you can find within this project.

## Installation

You can find the newest _.unitypackage_ file on [my itch.io account](https://molendinumgames.itch.io/) or in [this director]([https://github.com/MolendinumGames/UnityCoreTools/tree/main/Assets/ProductivityTools](https://github.com/MolendinumGames/UnityCoreTools/tree/main/Assets/CoreTools/NodeSystem))

**Note:** I recommend using an engine version of **Unity2021.3LTS or higher**.

To use the node-system simply import the unitypackage file into your project.
