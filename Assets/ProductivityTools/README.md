## Installation

You can find the newest _.unitypackage_ file on [my itch.io account](https://molendinumgames.itch.io/) or in [this repository](https://github.com/MolendinumGames/UnityCoreTools/tree/main/Assets/ProductivityTools)

**Note:** I recommend using an engine version of **Unity2021.3LTS or higher**.

Import the package into your project. Afterwards you can access the tools by finding the Tools tab at the top of your editor.

The tools are in an editor folder and will not be included in a 
final build or affect the performance of the final product.

All tools are also in their own assembly and will not affect your
compile times.
